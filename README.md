GAME-OF-LIFE
------------

The "game" is a zero-player game meaning that its volution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or, for advanced players, 
by creating patterns with particular properties. This game was written in C++ using my own hash table template.
